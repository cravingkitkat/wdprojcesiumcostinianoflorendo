# Title: In Teyvat

## Description:

Dive into the enchanting world of Genshin Impact! This fanmade site uncovers the nations, characters, and history of Teyvat. 

## Outline:

##### Home Page:

When opening the home page, there will be a quick animation and specific music. Once the animation finishes, there will be seven buttons, one for each nation in Genshin Impact. These buttons revolve around one larger button that has a pattern that can be seen all over the world of Teyvat, the triquetra symbol.

##### Page 1 (Mondstadt):

When the button for Mondstadt on the home page is clicked, the user will be redirected to this page, which will play a short animation and play Mondstadt-themed music. Once the animation finishes, the page will display Mondstadt scenery in the background, with text boxes describing the storyline of Mondstadt. If the user scrolls down, the user will see an image of Mondstadt's archon, with a text box on the right describing the archon. Going down further shows the roster of playable characters in this nation.

##### Page 2 (Liyue):

When the button for Liyue on the home page is clicked, the user will be redirected to this page, which will play a short animation and play Liyue-themed music. Once the animation finishes, the page will display Liyue scenery in the background, with text boxes describing the storyline of Liyue. If the user scrolls down, the user will see an image of Liyue's archon, with a text box on the right describing the archon. Going down further shows the roster of playable characters in this nation.

## Js Description:

JavaScript will be used on the homepage to play music and display the animations when the website loads. It will initially hide the buttons that redirect users to other web pages and manage the redirection to those pages. We will also implement JavaScript code to have the buttons appear after the animation finishes and to make the smaller buttons revolve around the large button.
