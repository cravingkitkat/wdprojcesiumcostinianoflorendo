          Inazuma, the nation of Electro, is a nation that focuses on eternity. It is inspired by Japanese culture, and its architecture is a blend of traditional and modern styles, with castles, gardens, and bustling city streets. The nation is governed by the Raiden Shogun,  the Electro Archon and God of Eternityâ€” who maintains order and preserve the nation's eternity.

          Inazuma is an archipelagic region that is full isolated. The area has endless thunderstorms, and the people have a strong sense of resilience. The nation's isolationist policies have led to a unique culture, where tradition and modernity collide.

          The Raiden Shogun, also known as Ei, is the God of Eternity and the Electro Archon. She is a complex character, balancing her role as a ruler with her personal struggles. Ei and Makoto were twin gods, with Makoto being the Shogunate, and Ei being the shadow warrior. After Makoto died in the cataclysm 500 years ago, Ei assumed the role of Shogunate. She transferred her consciousness into the Musou Isshin, a sword kept in the heart of a puppet which controlled Inazuma while Ei was in the Plane of Euthymia.
