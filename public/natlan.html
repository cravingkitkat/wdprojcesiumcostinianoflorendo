          The Pyro Archon is a human, ascending to the divine throne after they win the Pilgrimage, a combat tournament held to keep the Sacred Flame alive. When a new Pyro Archon ascends to the divine throne, they will awaken their "inner flame" and get all of the memories of previous Pyro Archons. Each Pyro Archon has the Ancient Name "Kiongozi" which means leader. They are responsible for protecting and keeping the Sacred Flame alive, which protects Natlan and its warriors.
