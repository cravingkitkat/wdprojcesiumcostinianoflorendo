          Mondstadt, is the first nation introduced in Genshin Impact. It embodies the spirit of freedom and adventure. Its architecture, which was inspired by European medieval styles, has windmills, vineyards, and small villages in different areas. At the heart of the nation is Mondstadt City. It is a very active area, with bustling markets, lively taverns, and a strong sense of community.

          The people of Mondstadt are known to be carefree and optimistic, which is a reflection of their Archon, Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, who is also known as the God of Freedom. The Knights of Favonius, led by the Jean, are responsible for upholding peace and order.

          Barbatos embodies the spirit of freedom and is shown to be a carefree and playful figure. Because he values freedom, he actively refuses to take control of his nation and just wanders around the world, going from tavern to tavern, as a bard named Venti. His influence is seen in the people of Mondstadt. In the area citizens are often seen cherishing their independence and celebrating life, especially during their many festivals like the Windblume Festival and Ludi Harpastum. Barbatos is also known for his connection to the wind, which symbolizes change.
