          Liyue, the nation of Geo, shows the power of contracts and the importance of tradition. It is inspired by Chinese culture, and its architecture is a blend of traditional and modern styles.

          The people of Liyue are known for their hard work, resilience, and strong sense of community. They hold deep respect for their Archon, Morax, the Geo Archon, also known as Rex Lapis, the God of Contracts. The Qixing governs the nation, upholding the law and ensuring prosperity, while the Adepti are guardians of Liyue, protecting the nation from threats both internal and external.

          Morax, also known as Rex Lapis, represents contracts and the importance of tradition. He is a wise and powerful figure who has shaped Liyue's history and culture. Morax is deeply respected by the people of Liyue, who honor their contracts and uphold their traditions. His connection to the earth reflects stability and resilience, making him a guardian of the nation. He is the oldest of The Seven, being one of the only two remaining original members of The Seven. Before Rex Lapis retired, he would descend during Liyue's annual Rite of Descension to guide his people. Now he wanders the world as Zhongli.
